In a constantly changing world, communication is becoming more and more important for businesses and for personal growth. Having to communicate in school, present speeches at school and the university, take job interviews, and create your way in the working world all depend heavily on how good and effective of a communicator you are. Currently, and moving forward, machines and robotics will also take on most tasks, but the value humans have that AI tools won’t have is effective communication. Relationship tasks will still be reserved for only humans, which is the most human side of communication. The world will still need strong visionary leaders who oversee and inspire others with their communication. Communication is also about meaning and connection; both are human needs that will persist in an ever-changing world.

## Discuss

> 💬 Think back over your experiences in school and giving a speech:
> - How do you feel when you are asked to deliver a speech in class?
> - Do you feel able to evaluate the quality of your speech accurately? What went wrong, and what did you do well?
> - Have your spoken skills helped (or hurt) your ability to accomplish an important goal? If so, how?
> **Submit your reflections in the Padlet below.**
