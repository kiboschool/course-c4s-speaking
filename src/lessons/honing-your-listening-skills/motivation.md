> 1- Recall and describe a time when you felt truly heard in a conversation. How did it feel?

🗣 "Conscious listening always creates understanding...A world where we don't listen to each other at all is a very scary place indeed."

> 📺 Watch the following video on why we are losing our ability to listen and how we can counteract this loss.

<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cSohjlYQI2A?si=AAZZRqNH6JgAI-Ge" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;"></iframe></div>

As mentioned in the video, listening is a mental process of extraction, which uses a couple of interesting techniques, including:

- Pattern Recognition
- Differencing
- Filters that determine what we pay attention to. For example:
    - Culture
    - Language
    - Values
    - Beliefs
    - Attitudes
    - Expectations
    - Intentions

<aside>

🗣 "Most people are entirely unconscious of these filters, but they actually create our reality."

**- Julian Treasure**

</aside>

The video also talked about these 5 exercises and tools to improve listening:

- **Exercise 1: Silence.** Practice silence for just 3 minutes a day to reset your ears.
- **Exercise 2: Mixer.** When you are in a place filled with noise, try to notice and focus on the individual channels of sound. (Note: A great way to practice this exercise is to listen to music with headphones on and see if you can focus on different layers in a song).
- **Exercise 3: Savoring.** Listen to and savor the mundane sounds in your daily life (e.g., clocks ticking, traffic noise, household electronics).
- **Exercise 4: Listening Positions.** Consciously play with your listening filters to change the way you are listening.
- **Exercise 5: RASA.** Receive, Appreciate, Summarize, Ask.

🗣 "Every human being needs to listen consciously in order to live fully. Connected in space and time to the physical world around us. Connected in understanding to each other. Not to mention spiritually connected, because every spiritual path...has listening and contemplation at its heart."
