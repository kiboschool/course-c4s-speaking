## Brief

The development of your speaking skills should not stop at the end of the course. It should continue throughout your time at Kibo and beyond. To support this journey of continuous learning, the second final assessment for this course will require you to create a speaking action plan.

You should use the feedback given to you in each of the assignments you have submitted, as well as your reflection on the course, to highlight areas that you feel are good at and areas you will need to work on. The plan should be detailed and include SMART goals and concrete action items.

You will then record a video explaining your action plan and showcasing your speaking skills. Make sure you use all the lessons you have learned in this course in your video.

**Deliverables**:

1) A filled-out template (below) detailing your areas of strength and areas for improvement. For each of the areas you would like to improve, please make sure you develop a SMART goal detailing how you will get to the outcome as well as two actions you can take to achieve your SMART goal.

You can make a copy of this template: [Action Plan Template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_bCV06VMwSAEMZouIMmt5IIuOXy6--q4aAHUKkaD5Wg/template/preview)

2) After you have a set plan, you will record a 60-120-second video where you discuss the areas for improvement you have on your Action Plan while walking through what makes them SMART. 

As always, make sure you submit the audio and video versions of the assignment and incorporate the speaking skills we discussed during the course as you respond to discuss your Action Plan.

## Submission

Your submission should include:

- Your completed template.
- Your 60-120 second recording.

**Submit your assignment on Gradescope and then upload a copy to Anchor.**
