# Assignment Guidance: Technical Skills to Record Your Assignment

---

Having a good setup while recording a message is crucial to ensure that the message is clear and understandable. A poor setup can result in noise, distortion, and other audio issues that can make it difficult or impossible for listeners (the instructor and your peers) to understand the message. To ensure a good setup, as well as an accurate evaluation of your recorded submission, it is important to record in a quiet environment that is free from background noise. Additionally, it is important to take the time to properly set up and test the equipment before recording to ensure that the audio quality is optimal. By following the guidelines in the videos below, you can ensure that your recorded messages are clear, professional, and effective.

## Aesthetics

The effort you make before recording a video to share as an assignment or a video for a job can be noticed in the quality of your product. For technical, but also merit reasons, this might have an impact on the assessment of your video. Bad product quality also impacts the evaluator because it can be disturbing to listen well, distracted by a messy background, or bad video quality.

For that, it is of utmost importance that you pay attention to the details outlined on this page of the lesson. It is also important to ensure that you find a place with non-distracting background. Avoid windows, moving objects, or a vital space in the house where people are moving in the background. Tidy up your space and ensure that it is not cluttered or messy, and do your best to let the video watcher focus on only you and nothing else in the background.

If possible, add a plant or bookshelf as prompts to show off some personality, and finally, pick locations with good natural light.
