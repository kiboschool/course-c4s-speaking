**Step 2:** Using what we have learned in this lesson about interviewing, pair up with a partner and run through the list of questions we have seen previously in the course.

- List of Qs
    1. Tell me about yourself.
    2. Which experiences do you have that are relevant to this position? 
    3. What are your strengths?
    4. What’s your biggest weakness?
    5. Where do you see yourself in five years?
    6. Describe yourself in three words!
    7. How would you deal with conflict with a co-worker?
    8. Why should we hire you? (2 example answers!)

**Step 3:** Respond thoroughly to each of the questions. Record yourself being an interviewer and then an interviewee with your colleague. 

**Step 4:** Using this [template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1O6SpdVxFKVB1uzklo2cvSsCHFH0qICraBV_I9BYEjWI/template/preview) take notes on how your colleague did in responding to each of the questions. Please make a copy of the template and do NOT edit this one. Ensure you also leave your colleague’s comments on how they can improve their responses.

**Step 5:** After you are done recording the two interviews, each one should select one question they have answered the best and trim the video to only one. Please make sure that your video does not go beyond 2 minutes.
