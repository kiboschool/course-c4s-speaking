## Before the Interview

### Preparing for Your Interview

In preparing for your interview, it is important to confirm the interview location and direction prior to the day of the interview, or even ensure it is not happening online or which link or platform you will be using. In case the platform is new to you, you definitely should watch tutorials to ensure you do not show poor control of the technicalities of the process. In doubt, you should have access to a contact person and ask them all the questions you should have prior to the interview. Thorough research about the company you are interviewing with is also important. Knowing their culture, values, mission, and vision should help you shape your responses and give them a sense of familiarity with what they seek in a future employee.

### **Making a Positive Impression**

> ðŸ“º Watch the video below to learn how you can make a good impression during your job interview.

<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hMJayPMhhok?si=M1gnb8t1W4qFGrbZ" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;"></iframe></div>

From the video, we learned that to make a positive impression, you should:

1- Get to the interview venue 15 minutes before the interview time and dress up professionally. 

2- Offer a firm handshake and make eye contact.

3- Sit in the interview chair when offered.

4- Thank the interviewers for the invite.

5- Take a copy of your CV.

6-  Practice your answer to the â€˜Tell me about yourselfâ€™ interview question.

7- Take a 30-day plan of action: brief on the expectations, goals, and targets, learn about coworkers, learn policies and procedures, and set to work on important asks.

8- Using the STAR technique, prepare an answer to the most asked 10 questions in job interviews. (Check the list of questions below).

9- Ask three smart questions at the end of your interview: ex, what advice would you give to a successful candidate who wants to excel in this job? Can you tell me more about the team? What are the plans of the company over the next five to ten years?

## During the Interview

We have previously reviewed how to use the STAR technique to respond to both competency-based and behavioral questions. Letâ€™s watch a couple of responses you can use during the interview as you respond to common questions, such as:

1. Tell me about yourself.
2. Why do you want this job?
3. What are your strengths?
4. Whatâ€™s your biggest weakness?
5. Why do you want to leave your job?
6. Where do you see yourself in five years?
7. Describe yourself in three words!
8. How would you deal with conflict with a co-worker?
9. What are you looking for in your next job?
10. Why should we hire you? (2 example answers!)

> ðŸ“º Watch the video below to learn and review how the STAR technique can be used to answer some of the typical questions in an interview.

## After the Interview

The communication process for interviewing does not stop on the day of the interview, in fact, it continues until you hear either positively or negatively from the recruiters. Questions like how long will it take for you to hear from the recruiter, what questions to ask when accepted into to job, how to negotiate your job compensation, and what to do in case you are not offered the position. All of these are questions you should think of and start planning for.

> ðŸ“º Watch the video below to learn more about what to do after the job interview and how to address each of the components stated above.

<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BIY_oe4nUEk?si=jXiWKMqEzqeYzmL0" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;"></iframe></div>


As discussed in the video above, sending a follow-up email to the hiring committee/ manager could be a great step to leave a lasting impression. It also helps to give them a hint that you are still interested in the position after hearing more about it during the interview. The image below is of a template that can be used to send a follow-up email.

## Practice

> ðŸ“º Using the STAR approach, pick a question from the list below of traditional interview questions, and write up a response to it using the Padlet below. After you have a script that is tailored to your expertise, skills, and personality, record yourself as you rehearse the response to your question. Please keep recording until satisfied with the result. Make sure you follow the guidelines presented in the videos above.
