# Impromptu Speaking in Interviews
---

Interviews are situations where predictable and unpredictable questions are asked. Therefore, It is important to be prepared for both scenarios. In this course section, we will focus on impromptu questions and how we can address them during an interview using the STAR technique.

## The S.T.A.R. technique

The STAR technique is an interview technique that offers a simple framework to answer behavioral interview questions. It involves presenting the Situation, Task, Action, and Result of a particular experience.

**Situation:** Establish the context and provide necessary details about the situation in question.

**Task:** Describe the specific responsibilities or role you had in that situation.

**Action:** Detail the precise steps you took to address the situation or fulfill your responsibilities.

**Result:** Share the outcomes and achievements that resulted from your actions, emphasizing any notable accomplishments or lessons learned.

The STAR technique is used to respond to behavioral questions, such as:

- Tell me about a time whenâ€¦
- What do you do whenâ€¦
- Have you everâ€¦
- Give me an example ofâ€¦
- Describe a situationâ€¦

## What to avoid while using the STAR Technique

- **Lack of preparation:** Rambling and going off-topic by not preparing ahead of time.
- **Being too prepared:** Over-rehearsed and scripted answers that may not directly relate to the question.
- **Telling an 'OK' success story:** Sharing a story with no clear positive outcome or learning experience.
- **Not actually answering the question:** Being honest if you don't have a relevant example and redirecting the response.
- **Talking too generally about your experience:** Failing to provide a specific example that highlights relevant skills.
- **Not providing quantifiable results:** Forgetting to mention tangible results and outcomes.
- **Detail overload:** Including irrelevant details instead of focusing on key actions and results.
- **Not choosing strategic-level examples:** Failing to showcase strategic thinking and qualities for higher-level positions.
- **It's all about 'Us' and not 'Me':** Using "I" instead of "we" to emphasize individual actions and desirable qualities.
- **Never practicing out loud:** Neglecting to practice speaking answers aloud, leading to potential memory lapses or panic during the interview.
