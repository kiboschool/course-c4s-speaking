There are [10 questions](https://www.throughlinegroup.com/2017/06/13/public-speaking-10-questions-to-analyze-your-audience/) that you can use to help you have a better understanding of your audience, hence tailor your speech to their specificities. 

1. **Who comprises your audience?**
Knowing who my audience is involves understanding their demographic characteristics such as age, income, ethnicity, race, gender, religion, profession, political affiliation, professional experience, jobs, educational background, organizational memberships, and hobbies. This information can shape the way you present your topic as well as the content you include in your speech.

2. **How do they perceive you?**
Do the audience members already hold a particular opinion about you, your organization, or your profession? If there is a preconceived judgment of you or skepticism, it becomes important to establish common ground early on.

3. **What do they prioritize?**
Knowing the values that matter most to your audience allows you to align your speech topic with their core values. For example, if you are addressing a group of tech professionals that highly values the integration of tech in different fields, you might want to highlight how their interests and goals align with your organization‚Äôs goals. 

4. **How relevant is your topic to them?**
If the audience is already invested in your topic and understands its relevance to their lives, there may be no need to extensively explain why they should care about it. However, if they are unlikely to see immediate relevance, it is crucial to quickly establish the connection between your topic and their interests.

5. **How familiar are they with your topic?**
Understanding the audience's existing knowledge about your topic helps determine whether you should provide basic information, delve into advanced concepts, or strike a balance in between.

6. **How much information do they need to achieve your goals?**
While some speakers may assume the audience requires minimal information, they often end up presenting excessive details. This question serves as a reminder to ensure that the level of detail shared aligns with the necessary amount required to accomplish your goals.

7. **Do they hold a positive, neutral, or negative view of your topic?**
Assessing the level of resistance you may encounter can influence your speech content and sequencing. When dealing with groups that have a negative perception of your topic, it is generally advisable to address their potential objections early on before they raise them.

8. **What knowledge gaps or misconceptions do they have about your topic?**
Addressing significant misconceptions or knowledge gaps is best done early in your speech. Since progress cannot be made until these misconceptions are adequately addressed, you may need to allocate a substantial amount of time to clarify those areas before moving forward.

9. **What challenges or issues do they face related to your topic?**
Understanding the specific challenges or problems your audience confronts provides valuable insights into how they can apply the information you share. This knowledge can shape or narrow the focus of your speech to address their concerns. 

10. **Are you addressing a single constituency or multiple groups?**
Many audiences consist of various constituencies, some of which may have conflicting goals, such as senior managers and junior employees, supporters and opponents, or manufacturers and regulators. Andrew Dlugan, on his public speaking website Six Minutes, proposes three approaches for mixed audiences:
- Focus solely on one sub-group and disregard the others, which is a risky approach that works when you only need the buy-in from one segment.
- Tailor different parts of your presentation to address each sub-group individually.
- Ignore the differences among audience members and instead concentrate on common appeals.

To reach balance in evidence gathering, you can use a variety of techniques to collect your data:

1. **Your personal library:** This starts with browsing things you own. As an expert or learner in a given field, you should have some sort of resources about the topic, and that should be your starting point.
