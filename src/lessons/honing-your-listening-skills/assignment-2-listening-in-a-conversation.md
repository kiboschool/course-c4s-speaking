## Brief

Pick a scenario from the list below and pair up with a partner. Using Zoom, you should get together with your partner and record yourselves as you act out the scenario. One of you as **the speaker** and one of you as **the listener**.

You should do two different scenarios, where each of you plays the listener in one of the attempts and the speaker in the other.

After you are done, use the form below to give each other feedback and submit the feedback along with your recorded video.

### Listening Scenarios

- **Scenario 1**
    
    Your colleague had a very bad argument with their officemate about him bringing his friends over to chat and not respecting his space and privacy. 
    
- **Scenario 2:**
    
    You are wearing a T-shirt from your favorite TV show, and a woman at the store comes up to you very excitedly and mentions how much she liked your shirt and the show, then starts describing her favorite parts.
    
- **Scenario 3:**
    
    Your friend had a very rough day between school, a part-time job, and her responsibilities at home. She asks for a meeting to talk. 
    
- **Scenario 4:**
    
    Your friend has been applying to multiple companies for the past six months as a programmer but hasn’t heard from anyone. They feel very desperate, and they start venting to you.
