Most people tend to think communication is important when they are asked, but it has always been looked at as a spontaneous process. Bringing awareness to how you communicate will bring many positive effects to your life. 

Speaking effectively is defined as speaking in such a way that your message is clearly heard and, if possible, acted upon.  There are two main elements to speaking effectively: what you say and how you say it. 

1) **What you say** means your choice of words. The words you might use when chatting to a friend are likely to be quite different from those used in a formal presentation or interview. 

2) **The way that you speak** will also vary in different situations. However, there are also likely to be some common factors: for example, whether you naturally talk quietly or loudly and how you use body language, which we will explore in depth as we move forward in this course.

One way by which one can effectively communicate is by constantly evaluation our communication. We have previously looked at a practical strategy to evaluate your communication using the 7Cs.

In summary, you should have a better understanding and practice of the following strategies to become a better speaker in all of your life aspects:

1. **Think before speaking:** Avoid saying something inappropriate or unconsidered. Reflect on a subject before engaging in a conversation.
2. **Use concise language:** Avoid using complicated words that can confuse people. Prioritize important points and information you want to get across. Explain complex or technical topics in a way that everyone can understand.
3. **Understand your audience:** Tailor communication to suit their needs. Consider the context, culture, demographics, and shared characteristics of the audience. Provide relevant information regarding the topic. Show that you care about what they are saying and value their opinions.
4. **Be mindful of your tone:** Use a tone of voice to emphasize ideas and opinions with clarity and conviction. An enthusiastic tone can ignite passion and enthusiasm in others. A monotonous tone can put people off. Amplify emotions and express feelings effectively.
5. **Speak with confidence:** Use rhetorical questions, strong verbs, active voice, and vivid adjectives/adverbs. Speaking confidently can help project your message more effectively. Convey your ideas with clarity and precision.
6. **Show your authentic self:** Avoid pretense. Express emotion appropriately. Connect with your audience.
7. **Practice active listening:** Focus on what the other person is saying without making judgments or making assumptions. Avoid getting distracted. Pay attention to body language to ensure proper understanding and foster relationships.
8. **Pay attention to body language:** Facial expressions, gestures, eye gaze, and body movements can help build rapport and strengthen relationships. Pay attention to the expressions you use, the energy you emit, and the attitude you demonstrate.
9. **Prepare for any audience**: Assess the situation and consider who you‚Äôre speaking with and what information will be helpful. Consider if they possess any unique knowledge that you need to take into account. Knowing these factors can help inform how you communicate.
10. **Actively listen:** Focus your energy on hearing precisely what the other person has said, ask questions to demonstrate understanding, and provide feedback to show you have actually listened. Listening actively can ensure an understanding of needs and draw people closer together.
11. **Be empathetic:** Acknowledge other aspects of their life. Pay attention to their tone and adjust yours accordingly. Try to ‚Äúconnect emotionally‚Äù by noting certain life events or interests they may possess.
12. **Use the full range of your voice:** Use the right tone of voice to reinforce verbal communication. Use vocal inflection to emphasize the point and vary the pitch of your voice to keep the audience engaged while showing enthusiasm. Use appropriate emphasis on key points and vary the pace to avoid monotony.
