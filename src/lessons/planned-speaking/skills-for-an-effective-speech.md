## Anxiety Management as a Public Speaker

According to Craig N. Sawchuk, Ph.D., L.P. from the [Mayo Clinic](https://www.mayoclinic.org/), 

Public speaking can be a source of anxiety for many people, ranging from slight nervousness to extreme fear and panic. Individuals who suffer from this fear may avoid public speaking situations altogether or struggle through them with shaking hands and a quavering voice.

> 📺 Watch the video below to learn about how to manage anxiety as a public speaker.

Although anxiety is a common issue among public speakers, with preparation and persistence, it is possible to overcome this fear. Here are some steps that may help:

1) It is important to **know your topic.** The better you understand what you are talking about and the more passionate you are about the subject, the less likely you are to make a mistake or get off track. Take some time to consider what questions the audience may ask and prepare your responses in advance.

2) **Get organized**. Carefully plan out the information you want to present, including any props, audio or visual aids. The more organized you are, the less nervous you'll be. Use an outline on a small card to stay on track. If possible, visit the place where you'll be speaking and review available equipment before your presentation.

3) **Practice, and then practice some more.** Practice your complete presentation several times. Do it for some people you're comfortable with and ask for feedback. It may also be helpful to practice with a few people with whom you're less familiar. Consider making a video of your presentation so you can watch it and see opportunities for improvement.

4) **Challenge specific worries.** When you're afraid of something, you may overestimate the likelihood of bad things happening. List your specific worries. Then directly challenge them by identifying probable and alternative outcomes and any objective evidence that supports each worry or the likelihood that your feared outcomes will happen.

5) **Visualize your success.** Imagine that your presentation will go well. Positive thoughts can help decrease some of your negativity about your social performance and relieve some anxiety.

6) **Do some deep breathing.** This can be very calming. Take two or more deep, slow breaths before you get up to the podium and during your speech.

7) **Focus on your material, not on your audience.** People mainly pay attention to new information, not how it's presented. They may not notice your nervousness. If audience members do notice that you're nervous, they may root for you and want your presentation to be a success.

8) **Don't fear a moment of silence.** If you lose track of what you're saying or start to feel nervous, and your mind goes blank, it may seem like you've been silent for an eternity. In reality, it's probably only a few seconds. Even if it's longer, it's likely your audience won't mind a pause to consider what you've been saying. Just take a few slow, deep breaths.

9) **Recognize your success.** After your speech or presentation, give yourself a pat on the back. It may not have been perfect, but chances are you're far more critical of yourself than your audience is. See if any of your specific worries actually occurred. Everyone makes mistakes. Look at any mistakes you made as an opportunity to improve your skills.

10) **Get support.** Join a group that offers support for people who have difficulty with public speaking. One effective resource is Toastmasters, a nonprofit organization with local chapters that focuses on training people in speaking and leadership skills.

## Storytelling in Public Speaking

As we have seen in the first video by the Toastmasters winner of 2022, as well as many TED Talks we have reviewed in this course, almost all of them rely heavily on storytelling to share their thoughts. When it comes to captivating your audience, stories tend to be more effective than other forms of information. This is because our brains naturally process information in a narrative format in order to comprehend the world we live in.

> 📺 Watch the video below to review how storytelling is used in a speech.

> 📺 Watch the video below to learn about the elements of storytelling.

## Practice

> ❓ To practice storytelling, record yourself telling a story about your first day at school or the earliest memory of your childhood you can recall. Record yourself as you tell that story. Do not forget to use a good level of detail, and watch for your voice flow and volume. After you are done, please post in the Flip grid below.
