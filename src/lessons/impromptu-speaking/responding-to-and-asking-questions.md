# Responding to and Asking Questions
---

Part of being a good communicator is knowing how to respond and ask questions. In this part of the lesson, we will look into how to respond to different impromptu questions and how we can ask follow-up ones.

## Responding to impromptu questions

A well-known framework used in impromptu speech is the PREP framework. PREP stands for Position, Reason, Evidence, and Position.

> 📺 Check out the video below to learn more and reflect on the examples provided of the PREP framework.

**Point:** The claim represents the main point or proposition that you want to convey in your speech.

**Reasons:** Reasons explain why you believe your claim to be true, providing evidence or supporting arguments to strengthen your case.

**Evidence:** Examples or illustrations help to further support your main point and reasons by providing real-life scenarios, anecdotes, or testimonies that resonate with your audience.

**Point:** Conclude your speech by reiterating your claim and emphasizing its validity. Address any counterarguments or opposing viewpoints and demonstrate why your position is strong and supported by scientific, biblical, practical, or other relevant evidence.

When engaging in a short conversation, it is best to use one series of PREP to respond to your question. When giving a speech, the use of a series of PREP would be more practical to keep the conversation going. 

It is also important to maintain a good pace of breathing, speak loudly and slowly, and use pauses between each of the PREP phases.

> **Example**
> 
> **Point:** The departure of Steph from our organization will be a significant loss, and her absence will be deeply felt by all of us.
> 
> **Reasons:** Steph's impact goes beyond being a co-worker; she has been a true friend and a supportive presence for each one of us. Moreover, her exceptional skills as a software engineer, partner-relations coordinator, and office manager have contributed immensely to our organization's success.
> 
> **Examples:** Steph's remarkable work is evident in the creation of our current impressive website, which she meticulously designed, including all the content. Despite the challenges, she approached the task with a positive attitude and collaborated with the team to incorporate our ideas, resulting in a website that resonates with everyone. This effort has led to increased website traffic and donations to support our cause. Additionally, Steph's exceptional relationship-building abilities have fostered strong connections with our partners, allowing us to minister to them effectively and receive generous support for our mission. Furthermore, she has excelled in managing the office, ensuring its smooth operation and organization.
> 
> **Point:** These examples highlight just a fraction of the reasons why Steph's departure will leave a significant void within our organization. We will profoundly miss her contributions and her presence among us.

## Establishing Small Talk

Not everyone likes it, but you might be dragged into small talk on many occasions. With your colleagues, your boss, clients, or other people in your personal life. Small talk is an opportunity to instantly connect with people in your life in professional and personal settings, and it opens up the door to deeper connections.
