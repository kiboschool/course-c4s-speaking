## Lesson Overview

In lesson 3 of the course C4S 2, we will dive deeper into the different types of speaking situations you might encounter. Then, our focus will be on impromptu speaking, or speaking that happens with no prior preparation. Skills like asking and responding to questions are discussed in this lesson. The technical context we will be practicing in this lesson is sitting for job interviews and responding to interview questions. Activities and situational exercises for practice are provided on the course site, in the live class, and as an assignment.
